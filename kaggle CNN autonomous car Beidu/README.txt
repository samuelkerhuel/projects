!!!!!!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!!!!!!
This project is about the kaggle competition Peking University/Baidu - Autonomous Driving : Can you predict vehicle angle in different settings?

Data set is not posted here because it's huge, it can be found on kaggle

The approach uses resnet as many contestant.
We started from a notebook posted on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/phoenix9032/center-resnet-starter) and added some code to it 

Next steps will be to work on optimizing algorithms and try new algorithms i.e. YOLO
