!!!!!!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!!!!!!
This project is about the kaggle competition Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets : Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
It contains 2 notebooks.

The first one runs (LR,RF,XGB and DNN averaged.ipynb) 4 algorithms : Deep Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost. It was originally posted on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/kamalpangeni/disaster-tweets-with-lr-rf-dnn
This notebook is to be run directly in Kaggle environement. If run locally access to dataset should be modified.

The second notebook (analyze_results.ipynb) analyzes predictions to find ways to improve performance. It can be run locally.

Next steps will be to work on optimizing algorithms and try new algorithms.
